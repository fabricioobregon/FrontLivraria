# JS to Spring API App

- I took time adapting and commenting this code, help it will wake you start to figure out how things work in the front end.

Translates that it will prevent an external website to access your internal resources without explicit allowance by the web server API or using a proxy. For test purposes you can just disable this security feature following this instructions https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/
